This is a sudoko generator along with solver in C++. This was done as a project in DSA.
Just compile and run the main program and enjoy the process!
You get two options to either input your own suduko or use a generated one!
If you want to explore the sub programs such as the generator, the solver or the user input code, it is present in the subprogrmas files
do the same to run them to run open them and compile and execute
Have fun!
